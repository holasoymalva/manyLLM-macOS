# MLX Framework Integration Guide

## Adding MLX to Xcode Project

To complete the MLX framework integration, follow these steps in Xcode:

### 1. Add Package Dependency

1. Open `ManyLLM.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select the project in the navigator
3. Go to the "Package Dependencies" tab
4. Click the "+" button to add a new package
5. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift.git`
6. Select version `0.12.0` or later
7. Add the following products to the ManyLLM target:
   - `MLX`
   - `MLXNN` 
   - `MLXRandom`

### 2. Verify Integration

After adding the package, verify that:
- The package appears in the Package Dependencies section
- The MLX products are linked to the ManyLLM target
- The project builds successfully with the new dependency

### 3. System Requirements

MLX requires:
- macOS 13.0 or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) for optimal performance
- Xcode 15.0 or later

### 4. Usage

Once integrated, you can import MLX modules in Swift files:

```swift
import MLX
import MLXNN
import MLXRandom
```

## Next Steps

After completing the Xcode integration:
1. Build the project to ensure MLX is properly linked
2. Run the unit tests to verify MLXModelLoader functionality
3. Test model loading with a sample MLX model file
