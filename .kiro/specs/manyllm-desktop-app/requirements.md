# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ManyLLM is a native macOS desktop application designed to provide users with a private, local environment for running, managing, and interacting with large language models (LLMs). The application aims to compete with existing solutions like LM Studio and AnythingLLM by offering a user-friendly interface that caters to both average users and power users, while maintaining strict privacy standards through local-only processing.

The MVP focuses on core functionality including model management, chat interface, document processing with RAG capabilities, workspace organization, and optional API exposure for developer integration. The application prioritizes ease of installation and use, requiring no command-line interface, Docker, or complex dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern chat interface similar to ChatGPT where I can enter prompts and view model responses, so that I can interact with local LLMs in a familiar and intuitive way.

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with a sidebar and main chat window
2. WHEN the user types a prompt in the input field THEN the system SHALL display the prompt in the chat history
3. WHEN the user sends a prompt THEN the system SHALL display the model's response in the chat history with proper formatting
4. WHEN the user scrolls through chat history THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and display previous exchanges
5. IF no model is loaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating model selection is required

### Requirement 2: Model Discovery and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse, search, and download compatible open-source LLMs from repositories like Hugging Face, so that I can easily access models that run efficiently on my Mac.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the model browser THEN the system SHALL display a list of compatible models with details including name, size, author, and parameters
2. WHEN the user searches for models THEN the system SHALL filter the model list based on the search criteria
3. WHEN the user selects a model to download THEN the system SHALL download and install the model with progress indication
4. WHEN the user views model details THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive information about the model's capabilities and requirements
5. IF a model is incompatible with the current system THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate compatibility issues

### Requirement 3: Model Loading and Switching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load, unload, and switch between local models through the UI without using terminal commands, so that I can easily manage multiple models for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a downloaded model THEN the system SHALL load the model and indicate loading status
2. WHEN the user switches to a different model THEN the system SHALL unload the current model and load the selected model
3. WHEN a model fails to load THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN the user views loaded models THEN the system SHALL display current model status and resource usage
5. IF insufficient system resources are available THEN the system SHALL warn the user before attempting to load a model

### Requirement 4: Model Parameter Configuration

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to adjust basic model parameters like temperature and max tokens, and use system prompt presets, so that I can customize model behavior for different tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses model settings THEN the system SHALL display adjustable parameters including temperature and max tokens
2. WHEN the user modifies parameters THEN the system SHALL apply changes to subsequent model interactions
3. WHEN the user selects a system prompt preset THEN the system SHALL apply the preset to the current session
4. WHEN the user creates custom system prompts THEN the system SHALL save and allow reuse of custom presets
5. IF invalid parameter values are entered THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Document Upload and RAG Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload multiple documents and chat with the model using context from those documents, so that I can get answers based on my specific content rather than just the model's training data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uploads documents THEN the system SHALL support PDF, DOCX, TXT, and CSV file formats
2. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL extract text content and prepare it for RAG pipeline integration
3. WHEN the user asks questions THEN the system SHALL include relevant document context in the model prompt
4. WHEN the model references document content THEN the system SHALL provide citations or snippets indicating the source
5. IF document processing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and continue functioning without the failed document

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Local Processing

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want explicit assurance that all processing happens locally and my data never leaves my computer, so that I can trust the application with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first opens the application THEN the system SHALL display clear privacy information during onboarding
2. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL display a persistent indicator showing that processing is local
3. WHEN the user accesses privacy settings THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about data handling practices
4. WHEN any processing occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure no data is transmitted to external servers
5. IF network connectivity is required for model downloads THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between download and inference operations

### Requirement 7: Workspace Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my chats and document sets into named workspaces with history, so that I can manage multiple projects and easily return to previous work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new workspace THEN the system SHALL allow naming and organizing chats and documents within that workspace
2. WHEN the user switches workspaces THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of each workspace independently
3. WHEN the user views workspace history THEN the system SHALL display previous sessions with timestamps and summaries
4. WHEN the user saves a workspace THEN the system SHALL persist all chat history, documents, and settings
5. IF workspace data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and provide backup options

### Requirement 8: Developer API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to a local API server with basic documentation, so that I can integrate other applications and scripts with the loaded model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables the API server THEN the system SHALL expose a REST API compatible with OpenAI's chat completion format
2. WHEN external applications make API requests THEN the system SHALL process requests using the currently loaded model
3. WHEN the API is active THEN the system SHALL provide basic documentation and example usage in Python and Swift
4. WHEN the user disables the API THEN the system SHALL stop the server and close all API endpoints
5. IF API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 9: Installation and Onboarding

**User Story:** As a user, I want dead-simple installation through drag-and-drop without requiring CLI, Docker, or complicated dependencies, so that I can start using the application immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user downloads the application THEN the system SHALL provide a single .app file for drag-and-drop installation
